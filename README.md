ATM
For this exercise, you will be modeling an ATM. The ATM starts of with the following

Value	quantity of units
50	12
20	20
10	50
5	100
2	250
1	500
A user will be able to make a withdrawal from the ATM using a method like so

public void withdrawValue(int ammount)
Once the withdrawal has taken place, the program returns the following:

Customer withdraws £157

3 x £50
1 x £5
1 x £2
The program should then show the values remaining in the atm

Value	quantity of units
50	9
20	20
10	50
5	99
2	250
1	498
All code should be well written and should follow OOP and SOLID standards
All code should be thoroughly tested
Code should be made available on Github
